1. Open a terminal window on your Mac by pressing Control-Space and typing terminal. Click to run the terminal 
as soon as it shows up in the Search results. 

2. Run: 
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" 

3. Then run: 
brew cask install miniconda; brew install node; brew install nvm; brew cask install docker; brew install git

4. Go to https://console.cortex.insights.ai/ and log in with the credentials you received via email from Cortex

5. Download Cortex Studio and install it as usual

6. Open a terminal window and type 
npm install -g cortex-cli 

7. Create a free Docker account at https://hub.docker.com/signup

8. On your keyboard, press Command-Space and then type 
Docker. Run Docker. 

9. Sign in to the Docker desktop application using your new account. 

You should have everything you need to run Cortex! 

To check to see if you have everything you need (you should get a version number if it's installed): 

1. Open up a terminal and run "cortex --version" 
2. Run "nvm --version" in the terminal 
3. Run "conda --version" in the terminal 
4. Run "node --version" in the terminal
5. Run "git --version"  in the terminal 
6. Run "docker --version" in the terminal
If you don't receive a version number from any of these commands, try to re-run step number 3


P.S. Check out https://docs.cortex.insights.ai/docs/getting-started/cli/#configure-the-cli
for more info for CLI configuration

P.S. Everything should be installed via Homebrew, but just in case you need the direct links to Node.js and Miniconda: 
https://nodejs.org/download/release/v8.12.0/node-v8.12.0.pkg
https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg
You probably won't need them, but I'm providing the links just in case.
