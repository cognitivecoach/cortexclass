To check to see if you have everything you need (you should get a version number if it's installed): 

1. Open up a terminal and run "cortex --version" 
2. Run "nvm --version" in the terminal 
3. Run "python --version" in the terminal. You need to have 3.7 or above
3. Run "conda --version" in the terminal You need to haave 4.5.1 or above
4. Run "node --version" in the terminal You need to have 8.12.0 or above
5. Run "git --version"  in the terminal 
6. Run "docker --version" in the terminal
If you don't receive a version number from any of these commands, try to re-run step number 3

P.S. Check out https://docs.cortex.insights.ai/docs/getting-started/cli/#configure-the-cli
for more info for CLI configuration

P.S. Everything should be installed via Homebrew, but just in case you need the direct links to Node.js and Miniconda: 
https://nodejs.org/download/release/v8.12.0/node-v8.12.0.pkg
https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg
You probably won't need them, but I'm providing the links just in case.
