P.S. Everything should be installed via Homebrew, but just in case you need the direct links to Node.js and Miniconda: 
https://nodejs.org/download/release/v8.12.0/node-v8.12.0.pkg
https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg
You probably won't need them, but I'm providing the links just in case.
